						We practiced the follow-up experiment for the paper of 
						<a href="http://graphics.berkeley.edu/papers/Huang-EFD-2014-08/">
						Eyeglasses-free Display: 
						Towards Correcting Visual Aberrations with Computational Light Field Displays</a> 
						published in SIGGRAPH 2014. They have done the theoretical work and made good results 
						by simulation, but there was a lack of physical experiments to fully proof this theory. 
						We built a real optical setup with a camera and lenses and observed some good results 
						with our carefully calculated compensated images. 
						We've been interviewed by Reuters
						(<a href="http://www.reuters.com/video/2014/08/25/bye-bye-glasses-displays-that-correct-yo?videoId=340766583">link</a>)

						A recent trend in interactive modeling of 3D shapes from a single image is designing minimal 
						interfaces, and accompanying algorithms, for modeling a specific class of objects. Expanding 
						upon the range of shapes that existing minimal interfaces can model, we present an interactive 
						image-guided tool for modeling shapes made up of extruded parts. An extruded part is represented 
						by extruding a closed planar curve, called base, in the direction orthogonal to the base. To 
						model each extruded part, the user only needs to sketch the projected base shape in the image. 
						The main technical contribution is a novel optimization-based approach for recovering the 3D 
						normal of the base of an extruded object by exploring both geometric regularity of the sketched 
						curve and image contents. We developed a convenient interface for modeling multi-part shapes and 
						a method for optimizing the relative placement of the parts. Our tool is validated using 
						synthetic data and tested on real-world images.

						When watching TV series, different people like different plots. It is efficient for 
						the audiences to find an exciting plot if we mark the change point of different plots for 
						them before they watch. Youku, one of the famous internet media web has already marked main 
						change points for most TV series manually, but this costs the workers lots of time. In order 
						to save time, we developed an algorithm to find the change points automatically. We created 
						rules for iteratively removing cuts with features extracted from video stream and audio 
						stream. Our results contain all the change points in Youku.
